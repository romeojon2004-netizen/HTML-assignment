        <h1 class="h1"> FIRST ALBUM </h1>

        <p class="p"> In his first few years, earls' raps were 
          incredibly vulgar and shocking with their lyrical content. He would 
          be sent to a camp in Samoa by his mother saying that he needed to be 
          straightened out, due to his drug use. After coming back after a year 
          and a half he would release his debut album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_(album)" class="link" style="font-style: italic;"> Doris </a> which was a much 
          more mature album.</p>
